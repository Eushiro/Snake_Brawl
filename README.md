# Snake Brawl
An adaptation of the classic game "Snake", "Snake Brawl" is a joystick controlled iOS game in which two snakes fight against each other! 

### Gameplay Instructions
Press the red button to start the game. Use the joysticks to control your snake. Eat some ‘food’ to grow in size, this gives you more health. When you hit the other snake head on, they lose one ‘health’ and become momentarily invulnerable. When a snake is hit at 3 health or runs into itself at any health, it dies.
